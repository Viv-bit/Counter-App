# Counter-App
I created a button component.
I created a state object by using useState ().
useState has both the state object and a function that helps change the state function.
I used (const) to help destructure the two elements in variables.
I set the useState to zero, since that is what i want the initial value to be.
I used an onClick attritube as my event handler and passed in counter+1 as the new value of the counter.


I used jscomplete.com/playground to ensure the code works because I don't have a react environment setup yet.
